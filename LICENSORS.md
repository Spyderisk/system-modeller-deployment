# List of Spyderisk Deployment copyright licensors/owners

Every individual and organisation listed here has chosen to license their work
to the world under Open Source terms and conditions. We have incorporated that
work into Spyderisk. Thank you.

If you feel you should be listed here but are not, then please
[do get in touch](mailto://team@spyderisk.org).

Each owner/licensor is listed with an indication of at least one of their
contributions, however, this is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.
Refer to the Spyderisk source tree for exact details.  Only the first
contribution of an Owner is noted here, just as a handy hint. Some Owners have
dozens of contributions.

Note: authors of many thousands of lines of Spyderisk code are not listed here,
because their employment contracts mean they are not Owners. They deserve just as
much recognition, and are listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Corporate owners/licensors:

* University of Southampton
