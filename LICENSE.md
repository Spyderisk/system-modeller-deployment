# Short summary

Spyderisk is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

The [README in the licenses directory](./LICENSES/README.md) explains *how* developers should apply
license headers to files in Spyderisk. This document is about the *why and what* of licensing.

The site [TL;DR Legal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2-0-apache-2-0)
summarises the Apache license as:
> You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices.
> This permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

For most people most of the time, this is all you need to know - please use and enjoy Spyderisk!

# Spyderisk Open Project Copyright and Licenses

Spyderisk source code is available entirely under [Open
Source](https://opensource.org/osd) licenses, either the [Apache2
license](licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) as described above, or occasionally other licenses which are
compatible with Apache2. 

We use the [SPDX software component descriptors](https://spdx.dev/), which is a
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) system. These are just a particular format for
headers of source files, and a template is given in the [LICENCES directory](./LICENSES/README.md).

Spyderisk documentation is generally under a Creative Commons license, again
explained in detail in [LICENSES](LICENSES/README.md).

# Licensor or Contributor?

The distinction matters legally, but in the day-to-day we just want to
acknowledge the work done by many people over the years. Only someone who owns
code has the right to license that code. Many substantial Spyderisk
contributors commit their work but do not own their contributions, and
therefore they cannot be a licensor.

# No CLA

As a matter of policy, Spyderisk does not and will not have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA),
for reaons similar to [Red Hat](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems),
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jun/09/do-not-need-cla/) and
other leading open source voices. 

Spyderisk adheres to the "inbound = outbound" principle, where Licensors get
exactly the same rights as anyone else in the world. While we use the excellent
Apache 2 license from [apache.org](https://apache.org), Spyderisk is not
affiliated with apache.org, and we do not use the Apache CLAs or other tools
which do not share rights equally with all.
